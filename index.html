            <div class="about-me">Hello World! I am very excited to start my coding journey. I never thought that I
                would become a developer but here I am! <BR>
                I grew up in Mexico City where I spent most of my childhood. My dream was to become a professional
                Soccer Player (like most kids in Mexico). However, that dream came to an end after getting a knee
                injury. That's when I had to go to school and study a carreer :(<BR>
                I chose Hospitality Managemant since I'm a people person, love hosting and appreciate good food and
                wine.
                After graduating, I opened and managed a Mexican/American fusion restaurant for 3 years, it was
                delicious! After selling the restaurant I moved to San Francisco and I've lived here since then, that
                was 12 years ago. I managed some high end Restaurants and Banquet
                Facilities throughout the Bay Area, my favorite was The Top of the Mark at the Mark Hopkins Hotel. After
                7 years of this work, I decided it was time to persue a different career that would offer a better
                work/life balance.<BR>
                I enrolled in a Software Quality Assurance Program and started my Software Engineering Career 7
                years ago! I have to admit, it was pretty hard to transition into a new career, but it was best
                decission I ever made! I am now trying to work on improving
                my technical skills so I can get a more senior position, or even better, decome a Full-Stack Developer!
